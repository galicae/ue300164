# UE 300164-1 Advanced bioinformatic analysis of single-cell data

This repository holds the material for the course "300164-1 Advanced bioinformatic analysis of
single-cell data". It is held every summer term at the University of Vienna. Over time, I intend to
keep evolving this document and the material in the course to reflect the change in the students'
background, the needs of the department, and current developments in the analysis of single-cell
RNA-seq data.

## Course description
