Master Evolutionary Systems Biology	Master student	8	Biologische Daten: Einführung in Statistik und SPSS, Grundlagen der Bioinformatik, Current topics in computational biology, Mathematical Basics for Quantitative Biology	Basics in staistics helped to understand the data wrangling (matrix manipulation: normalisation, variance stabilisation etc). Understanding how scRNAseq works also helped a lot I think.	6	6	5	I feel like I /really/ learnt how exactly data transformations affect the data and, on a fundamental level, the differences between various methods (be it for integration or clustering) and how to choose an appropriate one. Which is really quite transferable in almost all data analysis and not just scRNAseq. Also I learnt how to not drown in the sea of new methodology released every other week (knowing what to look out for, identify base assumptions from the start etc)!	4	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	Best advice for me would be: make sure you have time! Mainly just to make sure to have time after class to review the concepts and codes gone through the day because with this block course format everything piles up pretty quickly. 	"disclaimer: these ""suggestions"" are not highly necessary, if the course next year is just like this one I'm sure it'll still be as impactful (in a good way). Is there any way to have the course shifted earlier in the semester? It's quite a heavy workload (if taken seriously) and to have it in June when exam season and submissions are around the corner, sometimes it feels like I had to sacrifice an in-depth reading of the assignments just so I can ""be done"" with everything./Overall I think it depends on the direction you'd like this course to go - building up on Alison & Juan's course to have advanced coding/mathematical concepts discussions, or intensely solidify the foundation and assumptions of everything Alison/Juan's course is built upon./Perhaps it'd be a good idea for participants to just freshen up their knowledge on basic statistical/mathematical concepts (like actually understand them) so your questions won't catch them off guard and it'll be a more productive/engaging discussion?/Probably helps if they have some R or Python programming skills (depending on which one you're using in the course) so they don't feel overwhelmed even if it's just you typing to demonstrate, and that way they'll feel less in despair (not me, I swear). Now onto other things: I think you really tried to embody the whole ""give a man a fish etc etc"" and it's encouraging, despite it being intense and requires a lot of attention/mental capacity. Consider taking on BSc/early MSc courses to (hopefully) motivate more students! Your knowledge and enthusiasm carried the whole course! I think if it was another lecturer with half the enthusiasm and excitement, I can imagine the course to be much more painful to go sit through. Also I/we appreciate how you try to make examples relevant to all of us despite us coming from various backgrounds! Also the ""not exam"" is actually quite fine, the questionnaire didn't take /too long/ to answer, and the analysis part is fun to do - though somehow time flies when there are errors. As an aspiring data analyst/(pseudo-)bioinformatician I enjoyed this course very much though now I have more space in my head than I know what to do with :-)"
Master Evolutionary Systems Biology	Master student	6	Analyses of single cell transcriptome data, Current topics in computational biology, Mathematical Basics for Quantitative Biology	Yes. The Analysis of Single cell transcriptome data was a nice preparatory course.	4	3	7	To perform scRNA seq proficiently with a good knowledge of the theory behind it.	3	5	4	5	5	4	4	4	5	5	Be prepared for the theory and the philosophy behind the different steps such as Normalisation, Variance stabilisation etc.	The daily handout of jupyter notebooks were really helpful.
Master Evolutionary Anthropology + Master Bioinformatic	Master student	6	Biologische Daten: Einführung in Statistik und SPSS	No. "Biologische Daten" focuses mainly on the classic statistic test, like t-test, u-test, etc. and how the data has to be distributed to know which test to use. And then calculating the statistics in SPSS, but in SPSS you don't have to program anything, just use the provided funtions. We didn't even talk about PCA in the course.	5	3	3	I've learned a lot in this course. Not only did it gave a great insight into single-cell analysis, also the knowledge and discussions behind the methodology and biology was super interesting. Reading and interpreting the papers together was awesome. Learning about mechanisms how matrices and the derived statistics works is definitely helpful for me. It also made it way more enjoyable to read papers, because we were talking about the workflow in this fields and how the statistical part is implemented. I can definitely use this knowledge in my field and can't wait to do so. 	3	4	5	5	3	4	4	4	3	5		
Master Zoology	Master student	1	None of the above	Did not attend above courses. Python course from Jan prepared me a little bit coding wise	6	6	5	Much deepened understanding of single cell RNA analysis. Knowing how the basic steps of data analysis work and implementing some of them. New insight on biological concepty like cell types. Better knowledge on statistical methods like normalization, matrixes etc.	2	3	5	5	4	5	4	4	5	5	Be sure to have at least some basic knowledge of coding as it will help very much. Intense but worth your time for sure!	Things we talked about today at coffee. :) 
Master Zoology	Master student	7	None of the above		7	4	6	"The things I've learned during the course are quite different from the things I've expected to learn. I learned that the whole single cell seq world is way more complex than I've thought about it before - that underlying concepts and the way we are defining certain things are more than crucial to enable us to deal seriously with this kind of data. I think the most important thing I've learned is more something like a feeling, rather than hard facts (which is really valuable I think). A feeling of what all of the single steps mean, why are we doing stuff we are doing, what things / outputs we can trust and on which things we should better not rely on too much. For sure, in many details this feeling is not super elaborated yet and needs some important improvement and refinement - but I think, I've got a really good guideline and starting point for further development of this feeling. and this is also really helpful for interpretation of results and data - so I learned a lot about drawing reasonable conclusions, what output we can trust and what things involve random factors we cannot really control. I am not sure if I will directly be able to take this new knowledge and apply it straight on my own data, this might need some more time, but this is more than fine. "	2	4	4	4	5	4	3	2	5	5	take your time to really understand the fundamental concepts & take your time playing around with the homework - try to plan not too many other things / courses in parallel to this one. 	"you have a great talent to break down and explain rather complex things in a very understandable way & also in noticing when people are struggling and when it needs some further explanation. Normally, when I learn new stuff I really want to take my time to understand the things in great depth - for me its necessary to really ""incorporate"" the fundamentals to then be able to understand or memorise any of the advanced stuff building up on that. However, in most of the other courses, people do not really take their time to explain and focus on the basics befor moving on to other things. so the great focus you set on underlying theory and concepts was a really really big pro - maybe one of the biggest - of the course. I would definitely recommend to keep this and not cut down on those things for the next course. Another very important thing that I really liked is to be critical about things. why is single cell useful? What can we learn from that and in which situations is it more like a trend thing rather than a real need? All together, thanks a lot for this really great course, for putting so much effort in preparation and feedback and for your great patience with frustrated students!!"
