Please indicate your relevant field or discipline:	What is the current stage of your studies?	How would you rate your level of familiarity with single cell transcriptomics analysis?	Which of the following courses, if any, have you attended?	Did you attend any other courses that you feel might be relevant for this course?	How would you rate your proficiency in statistics (distributions, maximum likelihood, significance tests, etc.)?	How would you rate your proficiency in linear algebra (matrices, vectors, decomposition, manifolds, etc.)?	How would you rate your proficiency in programming (Python, R, bash, scripting, etc.)?	What are you hoping to learn in this course? What would you like to be able to accomplish afterwards?	How often do you currently use a specialised software with a point-and-click graphical user interface (e.g. SPSS, SAS, ArcGIS, Geneious, etc.)?	How often do you currently use version control software (e.g. Git, Subversion (SVN), Mercurial, etc.)?	How often do you currently use a command shell (usually accessed via Terminal on MacOS or PowerShell on Windows)?	Why are you participating in this course?	Having access to the original, raw data is important to be able to repeat an analysis.	I can write a small program, script, or macro to address a problem in my own work.	I know how to search for answers to my technical questions online.	While working on a programming project, if I got stuck, I can find ways of overcoming the problem.	I am confident in my ability to make use of programming software to work with data.	Using a programming language (like R or Python) can make my analyses easier to reproduce.	Using a programming language (like R or Python) can make me more efficient at working with data.	Please share what you most hope to learn from participating in this course.
